We use Node.js and Node Package Manager for much of our development.
Link for downloading Node.js and NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

In order to use the UI, you'll need to install Node.js for the npm command-line interface.
In order to run the UI in a browser, the angular CLI will be needed, so after setting up npm, run "npm install -g @angular/cli" in the command-line.

The command used to run the UI locally on your browser is "ng serve nameofproject".
